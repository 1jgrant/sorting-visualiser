### Features

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## How to Use

Use the controls to select the sorting algorithm, array size and any additional delay between animations. After changing the array size, select `Randomise` to generate a new unsorted array. Begin the visualiser by selecting `Sort`. The visualiser may be stopped with the `Stop` button. From there you can choose to generate a new array, or restart with the part sorted array.
